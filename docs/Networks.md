I’ve been involved with the EI conference since joining Cambridge in 2022, but 2025 was special as I co-chaired it with Prof. Fumiya Iida. Next year we’re planning some major changes as the EI community grows and expands beyond robotics into more diverse fields.

Together with two colleagues, I co-founded the Women in Robotics Cambridge network to support female robotics enthusiasts locally, nationally, and globally. Over the past two years, we’ve turned this idea into reality through a journey that’s been challenging, joyful, and deeply rewarding.
