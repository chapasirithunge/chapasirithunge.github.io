## 2025  

- **Just concluded EI 2025 Proceedings**: Embodied Intelligence (EI) Conference 2025 was a highlight for me, as I co-chaired the event with my supervisor, Prof. Fumiya Iida. The online format brought together speakers and scientists from diverse fields to explore EI collectively, and following the discussions we opened a call for papers that concluded in December 2025. I’m looking forward to the conversations emerging from the proceedings.

- **Published my first book**: Together with Prof. Fumiya Iida, I co-authored "Foundations of Embodied Intelligence for Robotic Systems", a text book for newcomers in the field of robotics.

- **Another event with Women in robotics Cambridge**: After a year since establishment, we, women in robotics Cambridge, wrapped up our very first casual Chat about Robotics event. It brought together robotics enthusiasts and researchers across three robotics labs across Cambridge: Bio-Inspired Robotics Lab, Control Robotics Group and Affective Intelligence and Robotics Lab to connect and share ideas.

- **Fun evening playing chess with college members at Newnham College**: My colleague Liuba Dvinskikh organised a casual chess session with college members. I hadn’t played in about 14 years, so it was refreshing to return to the board—relaxing, engaging, and full of good company.

- **Robots showcase at Cambridge festival**: Cambridge women in robotics organised robots showcase event with the Cambridge festival on the 29th of March. This event was intended for general public, especially kids from age 10 upwards. Had a fun afternoon on 27.02.2025 at BBC Radio Cambridgeshire promoting this event coming up at the Cambridge Festival. I spoke to presenter Louise Holland about our motivations with this event, robot building and women in robotics Cambridge.

- **Talk at CUED BioEngineering Conference 2025**: I had the opportunity to present my work on "Synthetic Generation of Pain Expressions for Robopatients" at the Cambridge University Bioengineering Conference on Friday, 21 March 2025, held at St. Catherine’s College. It was my first time speaking to an audience comprised entirely of biology experts—an exciting shift in perspective. I hope the talk sparked some interesting cross-disciplinary discussions. It's always fascinating to see how robots still evoke more fear than familiarity for some!

- **Teaching in Cambridge**: This marks my third year teaching at the University of Cambridge. So far, I have delivered lectures on Soft Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction, and Machine Learning for Robotic Control. My teaching journey began during my second year as a PhD candidate at the University of Moratuwa. The experience gained, combined with the outcomes of my PhD, led to my appointment as a lecturer in Mechatronics at Sri Lanka Technological Campus, just eight months after my defense in December 2020. Through this journey, I have gained valuable insights into teaching methodologies, from preparing lecture materials to effectively engaging with students across a wide age range, from young undergraduates to professionals nearing retirement.

##2024

- **Presented at Digital Roads of the Future Annual Review 2024**: Presented a poster on my research on "Multi-Agent Systems on Machine Safety in Complex Environments". The event was held at Cambridge Union Society on the 13th November. The event hosted all the PIs, academic supervisors, industry partners, research fellows of the Digital Roads of Future program and potential investors.
