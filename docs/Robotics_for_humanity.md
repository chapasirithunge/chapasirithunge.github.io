# Soft robots as representations of emotions

Robots can help explore how internal human states can be physically embodied, creating new forms of interaction beyond screens or symbols. This opens a pathway for soft robots as expressive, emotional, and communicative media in art and human–robot interaction.

Two artworks—a soft character and a soft flower—demonstrate how soft robots can physically embody emotional states for expressive and interactive art.
