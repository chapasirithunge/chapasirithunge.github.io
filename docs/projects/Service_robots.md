I started my PhD in 2016 with Prof. **Buddhika Jayasekara** in the **Intelligent Service Robotics Group**. This was when service robotics began gaining momentum in Sri Lanka, and the group grew steadily as new members joined. It was a turning point in my life: as one of the first members, I had the rare opportunity to help build the lab from the ground up.
